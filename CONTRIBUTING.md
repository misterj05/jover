It's a good rule of thumb to just follow
[GURU](https://github.com/gentoo/guru/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)'s
guidelines.

Please follow Gentoo/GURU commit and package naming conventions.
If you don't know what that means just look at the Gentoo or GURU git log
and repos.

If you are trying to submit a PR on anything other than
[Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/misterj05/jover) it will likely be ignored.
