They conveniently split the Qt ui into it's own repo right as I was making
the shadps4 ebuild so this is probably the first overlay that has this setup already.

If a dependency is available in ::gentoo, it is grabbed from there, otherwise
this ebuild uses the bundled shadps4-qtlauncher dependencies.
